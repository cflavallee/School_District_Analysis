# School District Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide key metrics for the school district.  And in light of the issue with 9th grade test scores for Thomas High School, to exclude that data when running the code and completing the analysis.  The following section will cover the key metrics and observations regarding the the effect of excluding the 9th grade Thomas High School(THS) data. 

## Results

### Top 5

Should the student count be the same after exluding 9th grade scores?
Charter schools performed better.
Smaller schools, which were all charters, performed better. 
The budget was higher for poor performing schools
